    "## POSSIBLE BUG \n",
    "\n",
    "The code you've provided seems to be the skeleton of a FastAPI-based web service for intent classification. However, there are a couple of potential issues and missing parts in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Incomplete implementation of the /intent endpoint: The intent() function is currently just a placeholder (pass). You need to implement the actual logic for intent classification based on the request body.\n",
    "Model loading in the main() function: The model.load(args.model) line should ideally be placed before running the server with uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=args.port) to ensure that the model is loaded before handling requests.\n",
    "Error handling in main() function: There's no error handling for loading the model. If the model loading fails, the server will still attempt to start, which may cause unexpected behavior. You should add error handling for model loading.\n",
    "Argument parsing in main() function: Although not a bug, it's worth noting that the --model argument is marked as required, meaning that users must provide a model path when running the script. You may want to provide a default model or handle cases where the argument is missing.\n",
    "No validation for model path: There's no validation to check if the provided model path is valid. It would be good to add some validation to ensure that the provided path points to a valid model file or directory.\n",
    "No error handling for server startup: If there are any issues starting the server (e.g., port already in use), it will fail silently. Adding error handling for server startup would make debugging easier.\n",
    "No logging: Logging can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the server's behavior. Adding logging statements throughout the code can aid in diagnosing issues."
